this project contain two phase

Phase1:
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL to make a .html page for data gathering and another .php page for inserting data to a mysql database.

Phase2:
I used Python to create a recommender systems from 69 submitted data 

Phase 3:
I'm going to complete it.
Notes of Phase 3:
In this project totally we have 30 movies in our database
When a user goes to the website, the system will give her/him 10 movie randomly. The user rates them from 1 to 5.
After that according to phase2 system recommend 5 movies (from other 20 movies in the database)
Finally the user will rate the accuracy of system recommendations.
